When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you anticipate you'll be working on your repository from more than one computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It lets you control which changes are pulled to your local workspace, allowing you to keep different versions of a log.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are only made on the github website and never in a local repository.  Clones are an identical copy of a committed version.  Branches are different versions of the same project, and are made in a local workspace.
