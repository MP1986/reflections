What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You set up the parameters needed to keep a history.  It's the first step in the process..

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

I didn't get this one.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By making you go through a self-checking process before you commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?

They would help when you want to try out two or more different versions of a 
project without immediately deciding which to go with.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

By visually representing branches and merges as a flowchart, it makes them easier to conceptually understand.
