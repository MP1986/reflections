How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It let me find it way more efficiently than searching through both files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By letting you easily revert to an older version if you don't like a 
    change you made, or to compare the merits of different versions.
	

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It would grant more control over what you choose to save, but carries the 
    possibility of error.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    So that users will have the option to choose a version control system that
    is most effective for whatever project they're uploading.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can view a quick summary of the changes that have occurred between
    versions, allowing you to easily pinpoint a particular one.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I'd be able to go back to an earlier version without fear of completely
    ruining something and not being able to find the cause.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
